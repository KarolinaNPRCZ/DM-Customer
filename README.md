# Solved problems

During the development of this project I had to face of a bunch of problems. These are a few of them.


-Organize code with independent modules
-Manage dependencies for these modules
-Build code that is maximal encapsulated
-Stick to predetermined architecture (Ports-and-Adapters)
-Authorization with JWT token and Spring Security
-Integration tests with TestContainers
-Stick to the SOLID rules
-Continuous integration and Continuous Deployment with Jenkins
-Organize work with GitHub flow
